1. In the beginning God created heaven and earth.
2. Now the earth was a formless void, there was darkness over the deep, with a divine wind sweeping over the waters.
3. God said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light.
4. God saw that light was good, and God divided light from darkness.

6. God said, 'Let there be a vault throguth the middle of the waters to divide the waters in two. 'And so it was.
